    - Do we want to be stateful? Should we load relevant information into memory?
        - PROS
            - (Likely) Faster response times for clients
        - CONS
            - More memory use
            - Will require additional behavior on startup to load results into memory
            - Results could be out of database
            - Background process could crahs server with two many results

        - OPTIONS
            - Hybrid approach could be more efficient, querying for results only when in-memory data is missing or considered stale?
